/**
 * You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative
 * integers.<br>
 * The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a
 * single digit.<br>
 * Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.<br>
 * <br>
 * You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
 * number 0 itself.<br>
 * <br>
 * Example 1:<br>
 * Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]<br>
 * Output: [7,0,8]<br>
 * Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.<br>
 * <br>
 * Example 2:<br>
 * Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]<br>
 * Output: [0]<br>
 * <br>
 * Example 3:<br>
 * Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]<br>
 * Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]<br>
 * <br>
 * Constraints:<br>
 * - The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].<br>
 * - 0 <= Node.val <= 9<br>
 * - It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have
 * leading zeros.<br>
